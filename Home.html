        <p>I’m a software developer with 2
            years of working experience
            designing and implementing digital
            workflows for different teams. I
            have gained experience in
            Software Development, DevOps
            and Project Management
            throughout my education and
            work. I’ve developed a broad range
            of skills to best support the needs
            of each team I’ve worked with. I
            plan on moving to Manchester to
            better facilitate working within the
            city centre.</p>
