                <hr>

                <p>I’m a software developer with 2
                    years of working experience
                    designing and implementing digital
                    workflows for different teams. I
                    have gained experience in
                    Software Development, DevOps
                    and Project Management
                    throughout my education and
                    work. I’ve developed a broad range
                    of skills to best support the needs
                    of each team I’ve worked with. I
                    plan on moving to Manchester to
                    better facilitate working within the
                    city centre.</p>
